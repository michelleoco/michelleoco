## 🎨 About Me
Hey! I’m Michelle — a full-stack web developer who started out as a visual artist and teacher. After spending over a decade creating paintings, installations, and teaching ESL around the world, I made the jump into coding. Now I build web and mobile apps — combining creativity with tech to solve real problems.

I love crafting clean, user-friendly experiences and translating abstract ideas into functional, beautiful software. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me hiking, skiing, or soaking up live music (Denver is great for that!). I’m always up for collaboration, sharing ideas, or chatting about art, tech, or whatever’s inspiring me that week.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you want to connect!

In-progress: 
- **Game Features:** Implement real-time marking of played songs and automatic BINGO detection/notifications.
- **User Archive:** Allow fans to save and revisit past BINGO cards as digital memorabilia.
- **Social Sharing:** Enable users to compare cards and share BINGO wins with friends.
